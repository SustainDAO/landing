                                        We are coming together to help bitcoin become one of our planet‚Äôs most sustainable asset classes!
                                                                    There is a lot of noise in the world about how the Bitcoin network is HORRIBLE for the environment. We believe that this is a MASSIVE misconception due to a lack of education and transparency from the industry. Bitcoin mining is not boiling the oceans!
                                                                    On the contrary, we STRONGLY believe that bitcoin is well positioned to become one of our planet‚Äôs most sustainable asset classes. In order to drive behavioral change of the network, BTC miners using verified clean energy sources should be financially rewarded.
                                                                    SustainDAO will pool capital together to help support this mission. Bitcoin can become one of our planet‚Äôs most sustainable asset classes!

                                        ‚ÄúSustainability‚Äù and ‚ÄúNGOs‚Äù are a broken model. Traditional sustainability mechanisms have been created behind closed doors by a bunch of industry leaders, companies, and NGOs. There has never been participation from the people. We are changing that, and making it a profitable endeavor to help drive sustainability for bitcoin.
                                        The DAO allows participation from retail investors to participate in a critical mission - making bitcoin one of our planet‚Äôs most sustainable asset classes.

                                        Immediately, SustainDAO will be a guaranteed liquidity source for bitcoin miners who are participating in the Sustainable Bitcoin Standard.
                                        Specifically, SustainDAO will buy Sustainable Bitcoin Certificates (SBC) from miners who have been awarded for mining bitcoin with verified clean energy.
                                        SBCs are an on-chain representation of Proof of Sustainable Mining.

                                        By participating in Sustain DAO, you are making the Bitcoin network more sustainable by creating a market for Sustainable Bitcoin Certificates that incentivize miners to operate sustainably.  
                                        This promotes renewable energy as whole, helps drive a positive bitcoin narrative in the media, furthers adoption of BTC by enabling ESG-focused organizations an avenue to invest in this emerging asset class, and by doing so increases the value of BTC.

                                          Sustainable Bitcoin Standard (SBS) has created a market-based solution that can help accelerate the Bitcoin network‚Äôs transition to clean energy.
                                          The objective of SBS is to bring together clean energy bitcoin miners, Institutional investors, energy producers, climate scientists, NGOs, and the bitcoin community into a protocol, designed to address the environmental concerns of the network. 
                                          SBS believes that Bitcoin powered by clean energy will soon be considered one of our planet‚Äôs most sustainable asset classes.

                                          Sustainable Bitcoin Certificates represent ‚ÄúProof of Sustainable Mining‚Äù  practices. 
                                          Due to the nature of the BTC network, each BTC is mined by ‚Äúall‚Äù of the hashpower available on the network, though the reward is attributable only to the first miner that solves the hash function. 
                                          From a climate change and impact behavioral change perspective, we believe that it‚Äôs crucially important to support responsible mining practices using clean energy and create behavioral change to shift the network towards clean energy mining, as the future growth of the network will lead to a critical total energy footprint.

                                          Any investor, institutional or retail, can be an end buyer of SBCs. We believe that SBC‚Äôs are a powerful new tool for investors with ESG mandates to utilize in order to put bitcoin on their balance sheet with an assurance of sustainable mining practices. Likewise, we believe that one day centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini will allow retail investors to co-purchase SBC and BTC, helping to drive the bitcoin network towards renewable energy.
